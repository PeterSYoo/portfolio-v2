            Hi! My name is Peter and I’ve fallen in love with coding. I come
            from an art background, I studied illustration in college and have
            worked professionally as a storyboard artist. Tech has always been a
            part of my artist's journey. I built my own websites in basic HTML
            while doing graphic design as a teen, and I fell in love with both
            the coding and design side. I’d spend countless hours just tinkering
            away in HTML and trying new things, looking at source codes from
            other websites. I have an eye for minimalist design that's sleek and
            professional and I enjoy both the frontend and data side of coding.
            I'm always curious about new technologies and have a passion for
            learning new things.
