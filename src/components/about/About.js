              Hi! My name is Peter and Iâ€™ve fallen in love with coding. I come
              from an art background, I studied illustration in college and have
              worked professionally as a storyboard artist. I started my coding
              journey back in March 2022 when I was first introduced to
              JavaScript and I haven't stopped running since. I have an eye for
              minimalist design that's sleek and professional and I enjoy both
              the frontend and backend of coding. I'm always curious about new
              technologies and have a passion for learning new things.
